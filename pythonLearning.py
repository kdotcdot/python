#Dot notation works on string literals ("The Ministry of Silly Walks".upper()) and 
#variables assigned to strings (ministry.upper()) because these methods are specific to 
#stringsâ€”that is, they don't work on anything else. By contrast, len() and str() can work 
#on a whole bunch of different objects (which we'll get to later), so they aren't tied to 
#strings with dot notation.
